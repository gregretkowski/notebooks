    "This tutorial builds off of [Outlace's excelent blog entry on Q-Learning](http://outlace.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Part-3/) and this is the [starting point](https://www2.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~weber/code/ActorCritic.py) for my Actor Critic implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I got interested in Actor-Critic reinforcement learning after skimming DeepMind's follow-up to their original Atari paper. The new paper [Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783) uses an Actor/Critic learning implementation to surpass the performance of their original Deep Q-Network. I couldn't find a good straightforward implementation/example of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a slightly more in-depth explination check out [Actor-Critic Methods](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node66.html) from the book 'Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction' by Sutton and Barto\n"

One small tweak I made is to end the episode if the Agent has made more than 40 moves but still hasn't made it to a terminal state."

For the value network, if we are in a terminal state, that's the value we tell the value network to place on that state. If we are in a non-terminal state, we tell the value network to place a value on the original state which is the reward in the original state, plus the discounted value from the new state. Note that the value network should return the maximum possible value for a given state. If the player's next move could be either jumping into the pit or arriving at the goal, we should set the value as if the best-possible action will be selected.\n",

It also places a very low value on the 'pit' position. Makes sense. Then we can see that the network places ever growing value on positions which move us closer to the winning position. Thus the value network can express to the policy network that a move which moves us closer to the winning position is more valuable. Lets take a look at what the policy network has learned."
